# ByteCoder/Artist

‚ú®üé® A modern, interactive web agency website showcasing and offering advanced animations, 3D effects, and smooth scrolling. ‚ú®

## Description

This project is a dynamic web presence for "ByteCoder/Artist", featuring visually engaging elements such as a fluid scroll experience, animated section transitions, stunning 3D graphics, interactive background grids, and distinct layouts for showcasing the team, work samples, skills, and client reviews. It leverages a powerful stack of standard web technologies combined with cutting-edge JavaScript libraries for high-performance animations and immersive 3D rendering.

## Features

Here's a glimpse of the cool stuff you'll find:

*   ‚û°Ô∏è **Smooth Scrolling:** Experience buttery-smooth navigation with [Lenis](https://lenis.darkroom.engineering/).
*   üñ±Ô∏è **Interactive Hero Section:** The initial SVG path dynamically reacts to your mouse movements.
*   üé¨ **Parallax Video Intro:** A showreel video container scales and subtly follows the mouse as you scroll past the introduction.
*   üë• **Animated Team Section:** Profile images aren't just pictures! On desktop, hovering over them triggers animated text transitions and delightful scaling effects. Includes a thoughtful responsive layout for mobile.
*   üåå **3D Tunnel Transition:** Dive into a dynamic 3D tunnel effect, built with [Three.js](https://threejs.org/), that seamlessly connects sections and is controlled by your scroll.
*   üñºÔ∏è **Animated Work Section:** Showcases your projects with a captivating horizontal-scrolling card layout on desktop, layered with animated 3D letters following intricate paths. Falls back to responsive stacking cards for mobile.
*   üíä **Dynamic Skills Section:** Features a vibrant, continuous marquee animation combined with a scroll-triggered reveal effect for the skill pills.
*   ‚ú® **Interactive Review Section:** A visually striking canvas-based triangular grid animates with a synchronized fill effect as you scroll, creating a dynamic background for the horizontally-scrolling review cards.
*   ‚úâÔ∏è **Animated Footer:** The footer content, including section titles and a large text logo, gracefully animates into view upon scrolling.
*   üçî **Full-screen Nav Menu:** A stylish animated overlay menu provides easy navigation with smooth transitions, hover effects, and a text shuffling animation.
*   üìç **Scroll-based Menu Highlighting:** Navigation links in the menu intelligently highlight automatically to indicate the section currently visible in the viewport.
*   ‚è≥ **Preloader:** (Implemented in `2.HTML` and `script.js`) Provides a polished loading experience with a counter and engaging animated circles before the main content appears.
*   üì± **Responsive Design:** The layout, styling, and animations are carefully adjusted across different screen sizes to ensure a great experience on desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.

## Technologies Used üõ†Ô∏è

This project is built upon a robust foundation using the following technologies and libraries:

*   üåê **HTML5:** Providing the semantic structure of the web pages.
*   üé® **CSS3:** Styling the visuals, handling layout, and basic responsiveness.
*   üíª **JavaScript (ES Modules):** The core engine for interactivity, complex animations, and 3D rendering.
*   ‚ú® **[GSAP (GreenSock Animation Platform)](https://greensock.com/):** The industry-standard JavaScript animation library, powering most of the complex sequenced and scroll-driven animations.
    *   **ScrollTrigger:** Enabling powerful scroll-based interactions and pinning effects.
    *   **CustomEase:** Defining unique, smooth animation curves.
    *   **SplitText:** Advanced text splitting for character-level animations.
*   üé¢ **[Lenis](https://lenis.darkroom.engineering/):** For achieving that signature smooth scroll physics.
*   üìê **[SplitType](https://splittype.js.org/):** Simplifying the process of splitting text elements into words or characters for animation.
*   üì¶ **[Three.js](https://threejs.org/):** The powerful 3D library used to render the animated tunnel and the dynamic letter paths in the work section.
*   üñºÔ∏è [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/) & [Ionicons](https://ionic.io/ionicons/): Providing scalable vector icons used throughout the design.
*   ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Vimeo: Used for embedding the video content.

## Getting Started üöÄ

To explore and run this project on your local machine, follow these simple steps:

1.  ‚¨áÔ∏è **Clone or Download:** Get the project files by cloning the repository using `git clone [repository_url]` or by downloading the ZIP archive.
2.  üìÅ **Navigate:** Open your terminal or file explorer and move into the root project directory.
3.  üñ•Ô∏è **Run a Local Server:** Modern browser security policies (especially for ES modules and local file access) often require files to be served over HTTP. The easiest way is typically:
    *   **Recommended (VS Code):** If you use Visual Studio Code, install the "Live Server" extension. Right-click on `index.html` or `2.HTML` and select "Open with Live Server".
    *   **Python:** If you have Python installed, open your terminal in the project directory and run `python -m http.server` (for Python 3) or `python -m SimpleHTTPServer` (for Python 2).
    *   **Node.js:** If you have Node.js installed, you can install `http-server` globally (`npm install -g http-server`) and then run `http-server` in the project directory.
4.  üåê **Open in Browser:** Once the local server is running, open your preferred web browser and navigate to the address provided by the server (usually `http://localhost:8000` or a similar address).

The `index.html` file will launch the main version of the site, while `2.HTML` includes the animated preloader experience.
